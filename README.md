# Mission 0X

Welcome. If I'm giving you this assessment, it's because I genuinely think you might be a good fit to join our team. This is designed to test for your expertise in building deeply polished and custom UI in React. Out of respect for your time, and in my very best attempt to avoid the pitfalls that bad take-homes often fall into, I want to emphasize that this assessment is very carefully scoped down to take a **maximum of 1.5 hours**.

If there is more you would want to build given more time, go ahead and just write out what you would do in the SOLUTION.md. These should be refactorings, feature improvements, or other organizational changes you would have made. You can also include other *major* UX or styling changes you would make, but don't let this be a time-sink.

Please don't publicly display or share this code as well. This includes putting it up in a public repository. There's a reason I'm not doing the same and simply sending you a link to it.
  
I'm looking forward to seeing your work :)

## Setup

I've provided a completely empty project for you to just `yarn` and `yarn start` with. No other third party packages or UI frameworks/libraries should be used. The mockup and assets needed for this exercise are in the `assets` folder.

## Objective

We will implement the mockup of this card as best as we can within the timeframe given.

### Assets
You can only use the assets provided in the `assets` folder to implement the mockup. The G logo is provided, and you can reuse the same profile photo file for the photos near the bottom of the image.
 
 You should implement the progress bar natively. 
  
### Functionality
The number of tasks done is actually an input that can be selected and changed. In this case, the user should be able to click on `25` and change it to `48`.

When this input is changed, the progress bar should animate and fill up its bar accordingly to the number of tasks done. 

The buttons do not need to do anything nor do they need any kind of hover/click styling. You can leave them be after implementing them. 

### Re-usability
You don't need to worry about cases where the screen is smaller than the component (i.e. breakpoints), but this component should still be re-usable. I should be able to render this component multiple times on the same page without any interface or functionality issues. 

## Contact

Please email dev@brevy.com for any questions you have at any point of this assessment.

Once you're done, please remove your `node_modules` and any builds, zip your project, and email it to the same address above. Please name it `<FirstName>_<LastName>_Mission0X`. If the project for some reason is still too big, feel free to use any other file hosting service and just email the shareable link. You should hear from me - at the latest - two weekdays after. 

Thanks again for taking the time for this. Talk soon.
